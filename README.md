✈️ Travel Ease - A Simple Travel Website

Welcome to the Travel Ease website! This project is a simple, two-page travel website built entirely with HTML. It's designed to showcase basic web development skills, focusing on semantic structure and common HTML elements.

✨ Features

    Home Page (index.html): Introduces the "Travel Ease" concept with a welcoming header, an "About" section with travel quotes, useful links, and a contact section.

Travel Highlights: A gallery of travel images is included to visually showcase different destinations.

Travel Essentials Page (main.html): This page provides practical information for travelers, including a list of essentials to pack, a list of top travel destinations, and a table of travel packages and expenses.

💻 Core HTML Concepts

This project demonstrates the use of several fundamental HTML tags and concepts:

index.html

    Document Structure: Uses <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> to create the basic page structure.

Text Formatting: Employs tags like <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <strong>, <em>, and <ins> 
for headings, paragraphs, and text styling.

Links: Features different types of hyperlinks: one that opens a new page using target="_blank" and another that jumps to a specific section on the same page using an ID (<a href="#Contact">).

Lists: Includes an unordered list (<ul>) for contact information and useful links.

Images: Uses the <img> tag with src and alt attributes to display travel photos.

Horizontal Rule: A <hr> tag is used to create a horizontal line, visually separating sections.

Header and Footer: The <header> and <footer> tags are used to define the top and bottom sections of the page, respectively.

main.html

    Return Link: A link is provided to navigate back to the home page (index.html).

Lists: Showcases three different types of HTML lists:

    Unordered List (<ul>): For the "Travel Essentials To Pack".

Ordered List (<ol>): For "Top 5 Travel Destinations".

Descriptive List (<dl>): For "Travel Terms" with <dt> (term) and <dd> (description) tags.

Tables: A table (<table>) is used to present "Travel Packages," with <thead> for the header and <tbody> for the body rows. The table also uses 

<th> for table headers and <tr> and <td> for rows and data cells.
